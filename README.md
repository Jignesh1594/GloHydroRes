## GloHydroRes - a global dataset combining open-source hydropower plant and reservoir data

This repository contains code of GloHydroRes project

## What is GloHydroRes
Analyzing the impacts of drought and climate change on hydropower requires detailed data not only on hydropower attributes such as plant type, head, and installed capacity, 
but also on reservoir characteristics like area, depth, and volume. Current open-source hydropower datasets typically lack information on reservoirs, while reservoir datasets 
often omit hydropower details. GloHydroRes is a global dataset that integrates open-source hydropower and reservoir data, offering 29 attributes, including key information such 
as installed capacity, plant type, dam height, reservoir depth, area, volume, and river name. Overall, GloHydroRes provides data on 7,775 hydropower plants across 128 countries.
